# Welcome

The knowledge base is mostly still under construction, main goal here is to summarise and categorise the materials that I have went through in the past.

There will also be some last minute cheatsheets I made when I was revising for certification exams. Note that these cheatsheets do not include all topics covered in the exam / course, but rather a few key points / topics that are easily confused or forgotten.

The knowledge base is divided into the following categories.

<table><thead><tr><th width="140">Category</th><th>Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6e1">🛡</span> DFIR</td><td>Fundamentals, Windows, Linux, Network, Memory Forensics and Tools</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2694">⚔</span> OffSec</td><td>Active Directory, Cobalt Strike</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f6a9">🚩</span> CTF</td><td>VM setup, Tools, Common techniques</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="2601">☁</span> Cloud</td><td>AWS, Azure, GCP</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f4bc">💼</span> Vendor</td><td>Splunk Enterprise, Carbon Black, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Cybereason</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f310">🌐</span> Web3</td><td>Solidity, Smart Contracts</td></tr><tr><td><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f5a5">🖥</span> Misc</td><td>Generic IT stuff</td></tr></tbody></table>
