# Consensus Mechanism

## Proof of Work

* Win by solving a very complicated computational challenge
* Mining: mining pools, solo mining, cloud mining

## Proof of Stake

## Delegated Proof of Stake

* Nodes use stake to vote for delegates to create blocks
* Delegates promise a percentage of block rewards for those who voted
